    "\n",
    "1. Please complete these questions in class, and if needed, after class, no later than __10/27__. You should submit the completed notebook back via Github Classroom.\n",
    "2. This is neither an exam nor an assignment - I will __NOT__ grade these. This is for you to test whether you are ready to move onto the next part of the class.\n",
    "3. Please __work with your peers__. You can learn much more if you work actively with your peers, by teaching each other. If you have not started doing so, this may be the perfect opportunity.\n",
    "4. Be __active__ in this class. I want to hear your opinions/soluions to problems below. So please speak up! This is a fair learning environment.\n",
    "5. Do __not__ try to copy code from others, include the Internet. The purpose is not to complete these questions, rather to test where your strengths and weaknesses are. Do not __fake__ it!\n",
